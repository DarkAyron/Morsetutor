Morsetutor
----------

This programme is intended to be used for learning and teaching morse code.
It can send random letter groups and prepared texts trough my telegraphy
interface.

I've removed the CDE-dependecies created by DtBuilder. If you need to
edit the GUI, apply nocde.diff after running the code-generator.
